Modify the four-function fraction calculator of Exercise 12 in Chapter 5 to use a
fraction class rather than a structure. There should be member functions for input and
output, as well as for the four arithmetical operations. While you’re at it, you might as
well install the capability to reduce fractions to lowest terms. Here’s a member function
that will reduce the fraction object of which it is a member to lowest terms. 

You’ll also need the usual member functions: four arithmetic operations,
input, and display. You may find a two-argument constructor useful.
