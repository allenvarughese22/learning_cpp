/*Create a class called bMoney. It should store money amounts as long doubles. Use the
function mstold() to convert a money string entered as input into a long double, and
the function ldtoms() to convert the long double to a money string for display. (See
Exercises 6 and 10.) You can call the input and output member functions getmoney()
and putmoney(). Write another member function that adds two bMoney amounts; you can
call it madd(). Adding bMoney objects is easy: Just add the long double member data
amounts in two bMoney objects. Write a main() program that repeatedly asks the user to
enter two money strings, and then displays the sum as a money string. Hereâ€™s how the
class specifier might look:
class bMoney
{
private:
long double money;
public:
bMoney();
bMoney(char s[]);
void madd(bMoney m1, bMoney m2);
void getmoney();
void putmoney()
