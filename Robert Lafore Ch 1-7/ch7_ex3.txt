Write a program that calculates the average of up to 100 English distances input by the
user. Create an array of objects of the Distance class, as in the ENGLARAY example in
this chapter. To calculate the average, you can borrow the add_dist() member function
from the ENGLCON example in Chapter 6. You’ll also need a member function that divides
a Distance value by an integer. Here’s one possibility:
void Distance::div_dist(Distance d2, int divisor)
{
float fltfeet = d2.feet + d2.inches/12.0;
fltfeet /= divisor;
feet = int(fltfeet);
inches = (fltfeet-feet) * 12.0;
}
