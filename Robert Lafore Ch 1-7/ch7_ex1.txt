Write a function called reversit() that reverses a C-string (an array of char). Use a for
loop that swaps the first and last characters, then the second and next-to-last characters,
and so on. The string should be passed to reversit() as an argument.
Write a program to exercise reversit(). The program should get a string from the user,
call reversit(), and print out the result. Use an input method that allows embedded
blanks. Test the program with Napoleon’s famous phrase, “Able was I ere I saw Elba.”
