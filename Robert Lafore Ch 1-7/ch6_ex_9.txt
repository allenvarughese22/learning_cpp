Transform the fraction structure from Exercise 8 in Chapter 4 into a fraction class.
Member data is the fraction’s numerator and denominator. Member functions should
accept input from the user in the form 3/5, and output the fraction’s value in the same
format. Another member function should add two fraction values. Write a main() program
that allows the user to repeatedly input two fractions and then displays their sum. After
each operation, ask whether the user wants to continue.
