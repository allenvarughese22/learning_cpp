Start with the String class from the NEWSTR example in this chapter.

Add a member
function called upit() that converts the string to all uppercase.

You can use the
toupper() library function, which takes a single character as an argument and returns a
character that has been converted (if necessary) to uppercase.

This function uses the CCTYPE header file. Write some code in main() to test upit().
