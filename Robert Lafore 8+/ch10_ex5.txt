Suppose you have a main() with three local arrays, all the same size and type (say
float). 
The first two are already initialized to values. Write a function called
addarrays() that accepts the addresses of the three arrays as arguments;
 adds the contents
of the first two arrays together, element by element; and places the results in the
third array before returning.

A fourth argument to this function can carry the size of the
arrays. Use pointer notation throughout; the only place you need brackets is in defining
the arrays.
