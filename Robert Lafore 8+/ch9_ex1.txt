Imagine a publishing company that markets both book and audiocassette versions of its
works. Create a class publication that stores the title (a string) and price (type float)
of a publication. From this class derive two classes: book, which adds a page count (type
int), and tape, which adds a playing time in minutes (type float). Each of these three
classes should have a getdata() function to get its data from the user at the keyboard,
and a putdata() function to display its data.
Write a main() program to test the book and tape classes by creating instances of them,
asking the user to fill in data with getdata(), and then displaying the data with putdata().
