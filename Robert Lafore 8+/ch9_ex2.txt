Recall the STRCONV example from Chapter 8. The String class in this example has a
flaw: It does not protect itself if its objects are initialized to have too many characters.
(The SZ constant has the value 80.) For example, the definition
String s = “This string will surely exceed the width of the “
“screen, which is what the SZ constant represents.”;
will cause the str array in s to overflow, with unpredictable consequences, such as
crashing the system.
With String as a base class, derive a class Pstring (for “protected string”) that prevents
buffer overflow when too long a string constant is used in a definition. A new constructor
in the derived class should copy only SZ–1 characters into str if the string constant is
longer, but copy the entire constant if it’s shorter. Write a main() program to test different
lengths of strings.
