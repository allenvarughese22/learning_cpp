To the Distance class in the ENGLPLUS program in this chapter, add an overloaded
- operator that subtracts two distances. It should allow statements like dist3=
dist1-dist2;. Assume that the operator will never be used to subtract a larger number
from a smaller one (that is, negative distances are not allowed).
