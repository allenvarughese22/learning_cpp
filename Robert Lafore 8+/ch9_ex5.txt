Derive a class called employee2 from the employee class in the EMPLOY program in this
chapter.

This new class should add a type double data item called compensation, and
also an enum type called period to indicate whether the employee is paid hourly, weekly,
or monthly.

For simplicity you can change the manager, scientist, and laborer classes
so they are derived from employee2 instead of employee.

However, note that in many
circumstances it might be more in the spirit of OOP to create a separate base class called
compensation and three new classes manager2, scientist2, and laborer2, and use
multiple inheritance to derive these three classes from the original manager, scientist,
and laborer classes and from compensation. This way none of the original classes
needs to be modified.
