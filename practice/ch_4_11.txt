Use the time structure from Exercise 9, and write a program that obtains two time values
from the user in 12:59:59 format, stores them in struct time variables, converts
each one to seconds (type int), adds these quantities, converts the result back to hoursminutes-
seconds, stores the result in a time structure, and finally displays the result in
12:59:59 format.
