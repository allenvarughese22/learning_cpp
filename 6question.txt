Start with the program from Exercise 11 in Chapter 4, “Structures,” which
 adds two struct time values. Keep the same functionality, 
 but modify the program so that it uses
two functions. The first, time_to_secs(), 
takes as its only argument a structure of type
time, and returns the equivalent in seconds (type long). 
The second function,
secs_to_time(), takes as its only argument a time in seconds (type long), 
and returns a
structure of type time.
